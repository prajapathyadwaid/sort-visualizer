# Sort Visualizer

Sort Visualizer is a tool designed to visually demonstrate different sorting techniques, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. This application provides a  way to understand how these sorting algorithms work through real-time visualizations.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort Visualization**: See how Bubble Sort iteratively compares and swaps adjacent elements.
- **Insertion Sort Visualization**: Observe how Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time.
- **Selection Sort Visualization**: Watch how Selection Sort repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion.
